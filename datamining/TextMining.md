Information Extraction
======================
IE systems have been developed that use many different trained classifiers such
as
  
 - decision trees [3], 
 - boosting [15], 
 - memory-based learning (MBL) [43], 
 - support-vector machines (SVMs) [40], 
 - maximum entropy (MaxEnt) [17], 
 - transformation-based learning (TBL)[68] and many others [64].
