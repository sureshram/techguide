### Static IP

http://hsukumar.wordpress.com/2008/04/15/static-ip-address-on-unix-and-redhat-machine/

## Backup
cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.bak

## Update the file with

NM_CONTROLLED="no"
BOOTPROTO=none
DEFROUTE=yes
PEERDNS=no
PEERROUTES=yes
IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=yes

## Add IPv4 Address

NETMASK=255.255.255.0
IPADDR=10.0.100.125
GATEWAY=10.0.100.1

## Edit and Set the Gateway where it connects to the outside world (router)
vi /etc/sysconfig/network
GATEWAY=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX


## DNS Settings for domain name resolution these are in the /etc/resolve.conf
PEERDNS=yes
DNS1=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
DNS2=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
DOMAIN=your_domain.com




Temp (Without Restarting)
# ifconfig eth0 143.229.xxx.yyy netmask 255.255.255.0
# ifconfig eth0 broadcast 143.229.xxx.255
Permanent (After Reboot)
cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0



and type the following command

$ service network restart

## Networking

** Execute "setup" from command line to see graphical options (even on putty)


/sbin/ifconfig - ip address of the box
hostname: displays hostname information

/etc/passwd for changing password

/etc/hosts : host file info

/proc/net/dev - for transport errors
netstat -s  for network errors
traceroute - checking routing for the ip address
uname: displays information about the operating system


#### Virtual Machine Network Fix - After Cloning
[Link](http://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/show/67673-device-eth0-does-not-seem-to-be-present-after-moving-or-cloning-a-rhel-centos-6-3-virtual-machine-in-vsphere)

1) Edit vi /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rule
The problem arises when CentOS/RHEL 6.4 tries to remember the existing NIC of the virtual machine. But in case of moving or cloning VSphere changes the MAC address. Accordingly linux OS changes the device name from eth0 to eth1 and so on after finding a new MAC address. Backup your old files. You need to change and delete the old "SUBSYSTEM" entries (in case are not being used) and rename eth1 to etho in the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rule accordingly to reflect the changes. After completing you also need to change /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 to change MAC and name of the eth0.

2) vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
change the MAC address of eth0 which is same in Subsystem udev rules file "vi /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rule".

3) start_udev

4) service network restart

where:
  

			
			

ifconfig: configures or displays network interface parameters

   To show information about all interfaces, enter:
	    $ ifconfig -a

ping: Sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts

   To determine the status of host www.cs.stanford.edu:
	    $ ping www.cs.stanford.edu

   To also have a record of the route to www.cs.stanford.edu:
	    $ ping -R www.cs.stanford.edu

traceroute: Print the route that packets take to the network host

lsof: list information about files opened by processes

This is a complex command not available on all unix (you can obtain a copy from ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/lsof/).

  To list all open files, use:

       lsof -i @snowhite.cis.temple.edu

  To find the process that has /u/abe/foo open, use:
       lsof /u/abe/foo
