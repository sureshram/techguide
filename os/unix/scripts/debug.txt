# Number of Open files for a pid
lsof -p 10990 | wc -l
#Change the settings in /etc/sysctl.conf

# Find Ulimit information for a pid
 ps -eF | grep java
 # use the pid from above to find the limits 
 cat /proc/{pid}/limits
# Solution: Change the settings using ulimit  command or change it in /etc/security/limits.conf

# Trace system calls of a process
# -f          Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced  processes  as  a  result of the fork(2) system call.
# -tt        the  time  printed will include the microseconds.
# -c              option  is  useful  for determining which system calls might   be   useful   to    trace.
strace -f -tt  -s1000 -p <replace pid>  -c


#### Network
# Test whether the network port is open and connectable
# -z      Specifies that nc should just scan for listening daemons, without sending any data to them.
 nc -z localhost 9200

#### Capture TCP Dump 
# -s - snap length 0 defaults to 65K
# -vv - very verbose
# -i - interface - any
tcpdump  host 127.0.0.1  and port 4505   -s 0   -i any -vv

nethogs, nettop, and jnettop for network performance
iotop is top, but for IO! Awesome!
iostat and lsof too for seeing what’s up with IO and files right now
top and htop for CPU stats, of course (pro tip: use htop instead of top)
strace because we <3 strace
perf is a magical tool that can do anything
atop which I don’t even understand what it is
pidstat is an amazing program for looking at both CPU and disk activity which we’re going to explain a little more later
ps xaopid,wchan:42,cmd is this amazing ps incantation Aria Stewart told me which tells you what every process is currently doing. whoa.
vmstat which I’m not totally sure what it is yet
dstat is like iotop and nethogs and top all rolled into one and I’m super into it.
