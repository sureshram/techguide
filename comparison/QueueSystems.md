Redis 
- in memory, key value store datastrucutre, no sql
- allow operations on data structures directly  on the database otherwise each client performing the operations will make the data inconsistent 
-Max Clients - In Redis 2.6 this limit is dynamic: by default is set to 10000 clients, unless otherwise stated by the maxmemory directive in Redis.conf.
- cluster setup is in alpha
- This means that Redis Cluster is designed to survive to failures of a few nodes in the cluster, but is not a suitable solution for applications that require availability in the event of large net splits
